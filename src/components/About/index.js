      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi there! I'm Tianna Johnson, a junior fullstack developer with a passion for building web applications. I have experience with a wide range of technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, React, and GraphQL.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy creating user-friendly and interactive websites that provide seamless experiences. My journey as a developer started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where I built a strong foundation in frontend development. As I delved deeper into web development, I became proficient in backend technologies like MySQL and MongoDB for database management and Express.js and Node.js for server-side development.
      </p>
      <p>
        React has been my go-to JavaScript library for building scalable and efficient user interfaces. I love working with React because of its component-based architecture and the ability to create reusable UI elements. Additionally, I have experience with GraphQL, a powerful query language for APIs, which allows me to efficiently fetch and manipulate data.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am constantly exploring new technologies and frameworks to expand my skillset. I believe in continuous learning and staying updated with industry trends to deliver modern and innovative solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am excited to collaborate on projects, learn from experienced developers, and contribute to creating meaningful and impactful applications. If you would like to discuss potential opportunities or have any questions, please feel free to reach out!
